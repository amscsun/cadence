### Algorithm and Data Structures

  * String and Array Algorithms (07/01/2019 ).

    __P287 Find the Duplicate Number:__
      Pretty basic, warming up the syntax and use both brute force, set and sorting solution.

    __P280 Wiggle Sort:__ Doing careful and patient analysis.


    __P695 Max Area of an Island:__ Review basics on BFS, as well as arrays.

    __P121 Best Time to Buy and Sell a Stock:__ Practice two pointers for stock type of problems.

    __P122 Best Time to Buy and Sell a Stock II:__
    ```python
    def profit(prices: List[int])->int:
      profit = 0
      for i in range(len(prices)-1):
        profit = profit + max( 0, prices[i+1]-prices[i] )
        return profit
    ```
